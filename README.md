Bike Sharing Demand Prediction

A multi-linear regression model to predict bike rental demand based on environmental and seasonal factors. This project analyzes how features like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and time-based variables impact bike-sharing usage.

Key Features

✅ Predictive Modeling: Built using scikit-learn to forecast daily/hourly bike demand.

✅ Feature Analysis: Identified key drivers (e.g., temperature, weather conditions) and their relationship with rentals.

✅ Robust Evaluation: Verified model performance using R² score, RMSE, MAE, and residual analysis.

✅ Data Preprocessing: Handled outliers, scaled features, and tested assumptions (multicollinearity, homoscedasticity).

✅ Business Insights: Helps optimize bike availability, pricing, and promotions.

Technical Approach
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to uncover trends and correlations.

Feature selection using statistical methods (p-values, VIF) to retain only significant predictors.

Model validation via train-test split and cross-validation.

Interpretability through coefficient analysis to explain feature impact.

Built with: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib/Seaborn
